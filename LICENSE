DIGITAL PUBLIC GOOD (DPG) NOTICE:

This software is designed as a Pan-African Digital Public Good, intended for
deployment and adaptation by law enforcement agencies across the African continent.
It aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 (Peace, Justice
and Strong Institutions) and complies with the Digital Public Goods Standard.

The pilot implementation is conducted by the Sierra Leone Police Force, but the
system is architected for multi-country deployment with configuration-based
customization to respect each nation's legal frameworks, identification systems,
languages, and regulatory requirements.

Countries deploying this system are encouraged to:
- Contribute improvements back to the community
- Share deployment experiences and best practices
- Respect data sovereignty and local privacy regulations
- Maintain the open-source nature of any derivative works
- Support other African nations in their adoption journeys
