### Target 16.6
**"Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels"**

#### How CRMS Contributes:

1. **Complete Audit Logging** - Every action logged (who, what, when, where) - immutable accountability
2. **Open Source Code** - Full transparency, community-auditable security practices
3. **RBAC System** - Proper authorization ensures officers can only access appropriate data
4. **Statistical Reporting** - Public dashboards for oversight bodies (Parliament, civil society)
5. **Privacy by Design** - GDPR and Malabo Convention compliance protects citizen rights
6. **Digital Public Good** - No vendor lock-in, country sovereignty over data

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Target:** 100% of state-changing operations audited
- **Target:** Monthly transparency reports for oversight bodies

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| **Low adoption** due to resistance to change | Intensive training, user-friendly design, demonstrable benefits |
| **Connectivity issues** in rural areas | Offline-first architecture, USSD fallback |
| **Data breaches** | Comprehensive security measures, regular audits, encryption |
| **Funding constraints** | Open-source model reduces costs, seek international donors |
| **Political instability** | Cloud backups, redundant infrastructure, multi-country deployment |
| **Interoperability challenges** | Standard data formats, APIs, regional coordination |
